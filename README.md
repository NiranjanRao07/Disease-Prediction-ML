# Disease-Prediction-ML

- As a part of my Machine Learning curriculum, me and my teammate have worked on this project.
- We have used 3 machine learning models to improve the accuracy of the prediction.
- There are two csv files, one for training and one for testing.
- Download all the necessary libraries and run the code in jupyter notebook/VScode.
